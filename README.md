# Puppy-Simulator
A puppy simulator program that has two basic functions which are
feed or play with the puppy. The puppy will react differently to these functions based on 
which state it is in. The puppy has three possible states: asleep, eating, or playing. 
The puppy simulator begins in the asleep state. When the puppy is asleep, the only way to 
wake it up is to feed it. It will come running when it hears its food bowl being filled.
When the puppy is eating, it can continue to eat until itâ€™s so full that it will fall back 
asleep (~2 or 3 times), or if you can distract it with a ball, then it will play with you.
When the puppy is playing, you can continue playing with it until it gets so tired that it 
falls asleep again (~3 times)
